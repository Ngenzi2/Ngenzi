# Oracle Database Project README

## Overview

This README outlines the steps taken to create and manage Pluggable Databases (PDBs) within an Oracle Database environment and configure Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) for monitoring and management purposes. The project focuses on setting up databases for educational activities, providing a hands-on experience with Oracle Database features.

## Prerequisites

- **Oracle Database (version 21c)** installed on Windows: Ensure you have the Oracle Database installed, which includes essential components for managing databases.
- **SQL*Plus client** to execute SQL commands: SQL*Plus is a command-line tool used to interact with the Oracle Database.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Create a Pluggable Database (PDB)

- **Purpose:** Created a PDB named `plsql_class2024db` to facilitate class activities where students can store their work during the course.
- **Details:**
  - **Username:** di_plsqlauca — follows the specified format for easy identification.
  - **Password:** nivid123 — a secure password for the database administrator.

**SQL Command Used:**

```sql
CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE plsql_class2024db
ADMIN USER di_plsqlauca IDENTIFIED BY nivid123
ROLES = (DBA)
FILE_NAME_CONVERT = ('C:\app\Divin\product\21c\oradata\XE\pdbseed', 'C:\app\Divin\product\21c\oradata\XE\plsql_class2024db');
```

- **Explanation:** This SQL command creates a new PDB. The `ADMIN USER` clause specifies the administrative user and password. The `FILE_NAME_CONVERT` clause specifies the locations for the data files associated with the new PDB.

### 2. Create and Delete a Temporary PDB

- **Purpose:** Created a temporary PDB named `di_to_delete_pdb` for testing purposes and to demonstrate the ability to manage PDBs effectively.
  
**SQL Commands Used:**

1. Create the PDB:

```sql
CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE di_to_delete_pdb
ADMIN USER admin IDENTIFIED BY nivid123
ROLES = (DBA)
FILE_NAME_CONVERT = ('C:\app\Divin\product\21c\oradata\XE\pdbseed', 'C:\app\Divin\product\21c\oradata\XE\di_to_delete_pdb');
```

2. Open the PDB:

```sql
ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE di_to_delete_pdb OPEN;
```

3. Close the PDB:

```sql
ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE di_to_delete_pdb CLOSE IMMEDIATE;
```

4. Drop the PDB:

```sql
DROP PLUGGABLE DATABASE di_to_delete_pdb INCLUDING DATAFILES;
```

- **Explanation:** The first command creates a new temporary PDB. The second command opens the PDB for access, allowing operations within it. The third command closes the PDB immediately. Finally, the fourth command drops the PDB and removes all associated data files, demonstrating the ability to manage the lifecycle of a PDB.

### 3. Configure Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM)

- **Purpose:** Started the Oracle Enterprise Manager Database Console to access and monitor database performance and manageability through a web interface.

- **Explanation:** The OEM provides a graphical interface for database administrators to monitor database performance, set alerts, and manage various database components without needing to rely solely on command-line tools.

## Conclusion

This project involved the creation and management of Pluggable Databases in Oracle Database. By performing these tasks, a better understanding of Oracle's multitenant architecture was achieved, along with practical experience in database management.
